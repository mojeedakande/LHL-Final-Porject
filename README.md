# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

Overview
The use of machine learning has the potential to redefine Revenue Management in the hospitality industry. The 
challenge in this industry lies in selling the right room to 
the right customer at the right moment and for the right price. However, last-minute cancellations and 
"no-shows" result in a loss of revenue, as the optimal 
allocation of hotel capacity is disrupted. Imagine if the 
industry could predict cancellations in advance.

Approach
This project focuses on two hotels: the Resort Hotel and 
the City Hotel. The dataset comprises 119,390 
observations, with each observation representing a hotel or resort booking. It consists of 32 variables, and the 
bookings included span from July 2015 to August 2017, 
encompassing both arrived and canceled bookings.

Objectives

Gain an understanding of and analyze booking 
cancellations, customer segmentation, customer 
satisfaction, and seasonality.
Perform descriptive analysis to identify patterns, 
anomalies, and other relevant insights.
Develop prediction models to determine the likelihood of a hotel booking being canceled or not.

Conclusion

our analysis of various prediction algorithms revealed that the Random Forest algorithm achieved the 
highest accuracy of 85% in predicting booking cancellations. It outperformed both Logistic Regression and 
XGBOOST in terms of low False-Negatives and high Recall.

Additionally, we identified the top features that contribute to the accurate prediction of cancellations, 
including lead time, average daily rate (ADR), deposit type, country, and more. These features play a 
crucial role in understanding and anticipating cancellations in the hospitality industry.

Based on our findings, we propose the following recommendations and future scope for improvement:

1. The hotel should aim to attract a broader customer base from all regions of the world, not just Europe. 
By expanding their target audience, they can increase revenue and minimize the impact of cancellations.

2. Special attention should be given to repeated guests who have shorter lead times. These guests have 
the potential to significantly enhance revenue generation, and efforts should be made to retain their loyalty.

3. In the future, the hotel can explore the implementation of dynamic pricing strategies. By leveraging 
predictive analytics, the hotel can optimize pricing based on various factors such as demand, seasonality, 
and customer behavior, thereby maximizing revenue.

By implementing these recommendations and exploring future opportunities, the hotel can enhance its 
revenue management practices and improve overall performance in the dynamic hospitality industry.
